## Bio

I am a biologist and data scientist. I did my B.S. in E&EB at Yale, where I studied physiological tradeoffs in wood frog tadpoles ([talk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S57rDgoKSm0I4ssGYlKlMgnDmXNs58aR/view?usp=sharing) | `r xfun::embed_file(text = "paper", 'Gahm_etal_2020.pdf')
`). In Fall 2021, I hope to start a graduate program in ecology/evolution, where I will use data-centric methods to study animal movement ecology and social behavior. 

Currently, I'm working with the Cary Institute to manage a relational database and improve data-management workflows. I've applied a lot of the same ideas to my work with a linguistics [research group](https://ygdp.yale.edu) at Yale, where I built a relational database and an interactive Shiny dashboard to make it easier for researchers and the public to explore the project's findings. 

I'm interested in advocating for open and reproducible data science and helping others to apply these ideas to their own work. On this blog, I describe some of my own insights in (hopefully!) friendly language.
