## Bio

I am a biologist and data scientist. Currently, I'm studying the social behavior and movement ecology of griffon vultures in the [Pinter-Wollman Lab](https://pinterwollmanlab.eeb.ucla.edu/). Previously, I was a data manager at the Cary Institute and a research assistant with the [Yale Grammatical Diversity Project](https://ygdp.yale.edu/). I've written about my work with each of these organizations: [Cary](https://kaijagahm.netlify.app/projects/2021-07-13-retroactivelyreproducible/) \| [YGDP](https://kaijagahm.netlify.app/projects/2021-02-05-ygdp-dashboard/).

I did my B.S. in EEB at Yale, where I studied physiological tradeoffs in wood frog tadpoles ([talk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S57rDgoKSm0I4ssGYlKlMgnDmXNs58aR/view?usp=sharing) \| `r xfun::embed_file(text = "paper", 'Gahm_etal_2020.pdf')`).

I'm interested in advocating for open and reproducible data science and helping others to apply these ideas to their own work. I run "Hacky Hours" at UCLA, and I'm on the Board of Directors for [SORTEE](https://sortee.org/). On this site, I also describe some of my own insights in (hopefully!) friendly language.
