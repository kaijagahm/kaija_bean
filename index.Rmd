## Bio

I am a biologist and data scientist. Currently, I'm studying vultures' social and spatial networks in [Noa Pinter-Wollman's lab](https://pinterwollmanlab.eeb.ucla.edu/). Previously, I worked with the Cary Institute to manage a relational database and improve data-management workflows. I also applied many of the same ideas to my work with a linguistics [research group](https://ygdp.yale.edu) at Yale, where I built a relational database and an interactive Shiny dashboard to make it easier for researchers and the public to explore the project's findings.

I did my B.S. in E&EB at Yale, where I studied physiological tradeoffs in wood frog tadpoles ([talk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S57rDgoKSm0I4ssGYlKlMgnDmXNs58aR/view?usp=sharing) | `r xfun::embed_file(text = "paper", 'Gahm_etal_2020.pdf')
`). 

I'm interested in advocating for open and reproducible data science and helping others to apply these ideas to their own work. I advocate for open and reproducible science as part of the Executive Committee at [SORTEE](sortee.org). On this blog, I describe some of my own insights in (hopefully!) friendly language.
