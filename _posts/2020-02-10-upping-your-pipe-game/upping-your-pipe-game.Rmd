title: "%$%: upping your pipe game"
description: |
  I love the `magrittr`/`dplyr` pipe: `%>%`. But it's meant to work with `tidyverse` functions, and it doesn't always work well with base R functions that take a single data frame column as input. Here, I use data about my friends' pets to explain how a different `magrittr` pipe, `%$%`, solves that problem.

## Problem

What do I do when %>% doesn't work?

## Context

I love the `%>%` pipe. Originally from `magrittr`, it's now characteristic of most `tidyverse` code. Using `%>%` has revolutionized how I write code in R. But sometimes the basic pipe falls short.

`table()` is one of my favorite functions for exploring data in R: it creates a frequency table of values in a vector. I use `table()` to do sanity checks on my data, make sure that all factor levels are present, and generally get a sense of how my observations are distributed.

A while back, though, I noticed that `table()` didn't play nice with the `%>%` pipe.

I've collected some data on my friends' pets. Here it is (using pseudonyms, in case anyone has a secret pet they don't want the world to know about...).

```{r echo = F, fig.cap = "This is one of the cats in the data frame below. She would like to hold your hand.", out.width="150%"}
knitr::include_graphics("milge.jpg")
```

```{r}
# Load magrittr
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)

# Create data
pets <- data.frame(
  friend = c("Mark", "Mark", "Kyle", "Kyle", "Miranda", "Kayla", 
             "Kayla", "Kayla", "Adriana", "Adriana", "Alex", "Randy", "Nancy"), 
  pet = c("cat", "cat", "cat", "cat", "cat", "dog", "cat", "lizard", 
          "cat", "cat", "dog", "dog", "woodpecker"), 
  main_pet_color = c("brown", "brown", "multi", "multi", "brown", 
                     "brown", "brown", "orange", "black", "white", 
                     "multi", "white", "multi")) 

# Look at the data
pets
```

Unsurprisingly, it looks like there are a lot of cats and dogs! There are also a lot of brown pets and a lot of multicolored ones. Let's say I want to see a frequency table of the pet colors. I know that I can do this with `table()`, like so:  

```{r echo = T}
# Make a frequency table of pet colors
table(pets$main_pet_color)
```

But if I want to use tidy syntax, I might try to do it this way instead:

```{r error = TRUE, echo = T}
pets %>%
  table(main_pet_color)
```

What's up with this? The syntax should work. pet is definitely a valid variable name in the data frame pets, and if I had used a different function, like `arrange()`, I would have had no problems:

```{r}
# Arrange the data frame by pet color
pets %>% arrange(main_pet_color) # works fine!
```

So why doesn't this work with `table()`?? This problem has driven me crazy on several occasions. I always ended up reverting back to the `table(pets$main_pet_color)` syntax, but I was not happy about it.

Turns out, there's a simple fix.

## Solution

Introducing... a new pipe! `%$%` is called the "exposition pipe," according to the magrittr package documentation, and it's basically the tidy version of the `with()` function, which I wrote about previously.

If we simply swap out `%>%` for `%$%` in our failed code above, it works!

```{r}
# Make a frequency table of pet colors
pets %$% table(main_pet_color)
```

**Important note: Make sure you have `magrittr` loaded if you want to use this pipe. `dplyr` includes the basic `%>%`, but not the other `magrittr` pipes.**

## Why it works

The traditional pipe, `%>%`, works by passing a data frame or tibble into the next function. But that only works if the function you're piping to is set up to take a data frame/tibble as an argument!

Functions in the `tidyverse`, like `arrange()`, are set up to take this kind of argument, so that piping works seamlessly. But many base R functions take vectors as inputs instead.

That's the case with `table()`. When we write `table(pets$main_pet_color)`, the argument `pets$main_pet_color` is a vector:

```{r}
# This returns a vector
pets$main_pet_color
```

When we try to pass pets into `table()` with the pipe, `table()` expects a vector but gets a data frame instead, and it throws an error.

The `%$%` pipe "exposes" the column names of the data frame to the function you're piping to, allowing that function to make sense of the data frame that is passed to it.

### Outcome

The exposition pipe is great for integrating non-tidyverse functions into a tidy workflow. The outcome for me is that I can finally make frequency tables to my heart's content, without "code switching" back from tidy to base R syntax. Of course, the downside is that you do have to install `magrittr`, which is sometimes an extra dependency that I don't want to deal with. But it's nice to have the option!

```{r fig.cap = "Congrats, you made it to the end! Here are some more cats for you.", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("kitties.jpg")
```

### Resources

`magrittr` has a couple other pipes, too: `%T%` and `%<>%`. The package also has some nice aliases for basic arithmetic functions that allow them to be incorporated into a chain of pipes. To read more about these magrittr options, scroll to the bottom of the [`magrittr` vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html).
