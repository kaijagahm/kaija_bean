I've been "[community taught](https://twitter.com/TheStephLocke/status/1214569802804662274)" in R and coding. My [blog](https://kaijagahm.netlify.app/blog.html) is one attempt to give back by writing resources that others might find useful. But I also contribute to the R, coding, and EEB communities through other channels.

### R4DS Slack Workspace

![](communityEngagementImages/r4dsHex.png){width="40%"}

**Mentor** | October 2021 - Present

As a mentor, I hold office hours on Wednesdays from 4pm-5pm PST, where I answer people's questions about R. In my responses, I do my best to foster a welcoming environment, talk people through how to create minimal reproducible examples, and use motivating language. It's important to me to contribute to the welcoming R community that I encountered when I first started learning.

Join the Slack workspace [here](r4ds.io/join).

### UCLA EEB Hacky Hours

**Organizing Committee** | January 2022 - Present

**Contributor** | September - December 2021

Each week, a group of UCLA grad students, mostly from the EEB department, gathers to discuss coding challenges, provide a supportive workspace, and teach each other new tricks. I'm part of the organizing team at Hacky Hours, so I mentor students who show up to the co-working space and help organize mini-workshops for the participants.

### The Carpentries

**Certified Instructor** | June 2021 - Present

I became a certified Carpentries Instructor in summer 2021. I taught a modified Data Carpentry workshop at the [2021 SORTEE conference](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VS14jKmCFJoiHFXMZ74qLA-IvwU_A9rn1SSNVGVkdMk/edit), which focused on using Git/GitHub through RStudio.

Currently, I'm working with some of my UCLA Hacky Hours co-organizers to put together [a Software Carpentry workshop](https://ucla-hacky-hours.github.io/2022-04-09-uclaeeb/) for our department in April.

### RStudio Community

**Contributor** | July 2020 - Present

When I got started with R, I found RStudio Community to be a much more welcoming forum for asking questions than StackOverflow. When I have the time, I contribute to answering questions in RStudio Community, as thanks for all the help I've received there. [Here](https://community.rstudio.com/u/kaijabean/activity) is my activity on the site.
