I've been "[community taught](https://twitter.com/TheStephLocke/status/1214569802804662274)" in R and coding. My [blog](https://kaijagahm.netlify.app/blog.html) is one attempt to give back by writing resources that others might find useful. But I also contribute to the R, coding, and EEB communities through other channels.
