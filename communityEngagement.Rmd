I've been "[community taught](https://twitter.com/TheStephLocke/status/1214569802804662274)" in R and data science. My [blog](https://kaijagahm.netlify.app/blog.html) is one attempt to give back by writing resources that others might find useful. But I also contribute to the R, data science, and EEB communities in other ways.

### SORTEE (Society for Open, Reliable, and Transparent Ecology & Evolutionary Biology)

**Board of Directors** | January 2022 - Present

**Education & Outreach Committee** | January 2023 - Present

On the Board of Directors, I've been involved in getting our membership database up and running, as well as guiding the organization into its second year of existence. On the Education & Outreach Committee, I will help advocate for open science practices and develop/promote resources for researchers who are interested in implementing them. On the Membership Committee, I was in charge of getting to know our current members and recruiting others.

### UCLA EEB Hacky Hours

**Organizer** | January 2022 - Present

**Contributor** | September - December 2021

Each week, a group of UCLA grad students, mostly from the EEB department, gathers to discuss coding challenges, provide a supportive workspace, and teach each other new tricks. I'm part of the organizing team at Hacky Hours, so I mentor students who show up to the co-working space and help organize mini-workshops for the participants.

**Certified Instructor** | June 2021 - Present

I became a certified Carpentries Instructor in summer 2021. I taught a modified Data Carpentry workshop at the [2021 SORTEE conference](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VS14jKmCFJoiHFXMZ74qLA-IvwU_A9rn1SSNVGVkdMk/edit), which focused on using Git/GitHub through RStudio.

In April, I taught [a Software Carpentry workshop](https://ucla-hacky-hours.github.io/2022-04-09-uclaeeb/) for our department in April, focusing on the Version Control with Git section.

Upcoming workshops:

[Introduction to R](https://calendar.library.ucla.edu/event/9132353) (UCLA Carpentries Summer Workshops), 2022-06-23

Version Control with Git (2022 SORTEE conference), 2022-07-13

### R4DS Slack Workspace

![](communityEngagementImages/r4dsHex.png){width="40%"}

**Mentor** | October 2021 - August 2022

As a mentor, I held office hours weekly, where I answered people's questions about R. In my responses, I did my best to foster a welcoming environment, talked people through how to create minimal reproducible examples, and used motivating language. It's important to me to contribute to the welcoming R community that I encountered when I first started learning. This year, I haven't been as active in R4DS, but I still contribute occasionally to the community!

Join the Slack workspace [here](r4ds.io/join).

### RStudio Community

![](communityEngagementImages/rstudioCommunity.png)

**Contributor** | July 2020 - Present

When I got started with R, I found RStudio Community to be a much more welcoming forum for asking questions than StackOverflow. When I have the time, I contribute to answering questions in RStudio Community, as thanks for all the help I've received there. [Here](https://community.rstudio.com/u/kaijabean/activity) is my activity on the site.
