title: "Tadpoles"
description: |
  For my B.S. thesis project at Yale, I measured how fast wood frog tadpoles swim in response to a simulated predator attack, and how that swimming speed relates to their developmental rate. It turns out that developing fast comes with a performance cost, and that tradeoff might help to explain some of the patterns we've observed in wood frogs' developmental rates in the past.
  A short description of the post.
