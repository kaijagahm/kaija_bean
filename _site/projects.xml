      <title>Retroactively Reproducible: Lessons from a workflow audit</title>
      <dc:creator>Kaija Gahm</dc:creator>
      <link>https://kaijagahm.netlify.app/projects/2021-07-13-retroactivelyReproducible</link>
      <description>A talk I gave at the 2021 SORTEE conference about my experience implementing data management and reproducibility tools retroactively, for an existing project, even if best practices weren’t used from the beginning. I also discuss organizing and making sense of someone else’s analyses when approaching the project as an outsider.</description>

      <title>greenT: Exploring grapheme-color synesthesia</title>
      <dc:creator>Kaija Gahm</dc:creator>
      <link>https://kaijagahm.netlify.app/projects/2021-05-13-greenT</link>
      <description>For my whole life, I've associated colors with letters and numbers. This is called grapheme-color synesthesia. For my second major project in Shiny, I built an app to help me explain synesthesia to friends, and to learn more about the experiences of other synesthetes.</description>

      <title>YGDP Dashboard</title>

      <description>From June through December 2020, I taught myself Shiny and ended up creating a pretty complicated interactive dashboard for exploring dialect variation across the US. Here's a bit about my experience using Shiny, as well as the app itself for you to play around with.</description>

      <title>The Tadpole Olympics</title>
      <dc:creator>Kaija Gahm</dc:creator>
      <link>https://kaijagahm.netlify.app/projects/2021-01-29-tadpoles</link>
      <description>For my B.S. thesis project at Yale, I measured how fast wood frog tadpoles swim in response to a simulated predator attack, and how that swimming speed relates to their developmental rate. It turns out that developing fast comes with a performance cost, and that tradeoff might help to explain some of the patterns we've observed in wood frogs' developmental rates in the past.</description>
