I did my B.S. in E&EB at Yale, where I studied physiological tradeoffs in wood frog tadpoles (talk | paper). In Fall 2021, I hope to start a graduate program in ecology/evolution, where I will use data-centric methods to study animal movement ecology and social behavior. I am a biologist and data scientist.
