My blog is one attempt\nto give back by writing resources that others might find useful. But I\nalso contribute to the R, data science, and EEB communities in other\nways.\nR4DS Slack Workspace\n\nMentor | October 2021 - Present\nAs a mentor, I hold office hours weekly, where I answer people’s\nquestions about R. In my responses, I do my best to foster a welcoming\nenvironment, talk people through how to create minimal reproducible\nexamples, and use motivating language. It’s important to me to\ncontribute to the welcoming R community that I encountered when I first\nstarted learning.\nJoin the Slack workspace here.\nUCLA EEB Hacky Hours\n\nOrganizing Committee | January 2022 - Present\nContributor | September - December 2021\nEach week, a group of UCLA grad students, mostly from the EEB\ndepartment, gathers to discuss coding challenges, provide a supportive\nworkspace, and teach each other new tricks. I’m part of the organizing\nteam at Hacky Hours, so I mentor students who show up to the co-working\nspace and help organize mini-workshops for the participants.\nThe Carpentries\n\nCertified Instructor | June 2021 - Present\nI became a certified Carpentries Instructor in summer 2021. I taught\na modified Data Carpentry workshop at the 2021\nSORTEE conference, which focused on using Git/GitHub through\nRStudio.\nIn April, I taught a Software\nCarpentry workshop for our department in April, focusing on the\nVersion Control with Git section.\nUpcoming workshops:\nIntroduction to\nR (UCLA Carpentries Summer Workshops), 2022-06-23\nVersion Control with Git (2022 SORTEE conference), 2022-07-13\nSORTEE\n(Society for Open, Reliable, and Transparent Ecology & Evolutionary\nBiology)\n\nBoard of Directors | January 2022 - Present\nMembership Committee | November 2020 - December\n2021\nOn the Board of Directors, I’ve been involved in getting our\nmembership database up and running, as well as guiding the organization\ninto its second year of existence. On the Membership Committee, I’m in\ncharge of getting to know our current members and recruiting others.\nMore info about SORTEE here.\nRStudio Community\n\nContributor | July 2020 - Present\nWhen I got started with R, I found RStudio Community to be a much\nmore welcoming forum for asking questions than StackOverflow. When I\nhave the time, I contribute to answering questions in RStudio Community,\nas thanks for all the help I’ve received there. Here is my\nactivity on the site.\n\n\n\n",
