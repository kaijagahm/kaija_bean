I did my B.S. in E&EB at Yale, where I studied physiological tradeoffs in wood frog tadpoles (talk | paper). In Fall 2021, I’ll be starting a PhD in the EEB department at UCLA, studying vultures’ social/spatial networks in Noa Pinter-Wollman’s lab.\n            Currently, I’m working with the Cary Institute to manage a relational database and improve data-management workflows. I’ve applied a lot of the same ideas to my work with a linguistics research group at Yale, where I built a relational database and an interactive Shiny dashboard to make it easier for researchers and the public to explore the project’s findings.\n            I’m interested in advocating for open and reproducible data science and helping others to apply these ideas to their own work.
