My blog is one attempt to give back by writing resources that others might find useful. But I also contribute to the R, data science, and EEB communities in other ways.\nSORTEE (Society for Open, Reliable, and Transparent Ecology & Evolutionary Biology)\n\nBoard of Directors | January 2022 - Present\nEducation & Outreach Committee | January 2023 - Present\nMembership Committee | November 2020 - December 2021\nOn the Board of Directors, I’ve been involved in getting our membership database up and running, as well as guiding the organization into its second year of existence. On the Education & Outreach Committee, I will help advocate for open science practices and develop/promote resources for researchers who are interested in implementing them. On the Membership Committee, I was in charge of getting to know our current members and recruiting others.\nMore info about SORTEE here.\nUCLA EEB Hacky Hours\n\nOrganizer | January 2022 - Present\nContributor | September - December 2021\nEach week, a group of UCLA grad students, mostly from the EEB department, gathers to discuss coding challenges, provide a supportive workspace, and teach each other new tricks. I’m part of the organizing team at Hacky Hours, so I mentor students who show up to the co-working space and help organize mini-workshops for the participants.\nThe Carpentries\n\nCertified Instructor | June 2021 - Present\nI became a certified Carpentries Instructor in summer 2021. I taught a modified Data Carpentry workshop at the 2021 SORTEE conference, which focused on using Git/GitHub through RStudio.\nIn April, I taught a Software Carpentry workshop for our department in April, focusing on the Version Control with Git section.\nUpcoming workshops:\nIntroduction to R (UCLA Carpentries Summer Workshops), 2022-06-23\nVersion Control with Git (2022 SORTEE conference), 2022-07-13\nR4DS Slack Workspace\n\nMentor | October 2021 - August 2022\nAs a mentor, I held office hours weekly, where I answered people’s questions about R. In my responses, I did my best to foster a welcoming environment, talked people through how to create minimal reproducible examples, and used motivating language. It’s important to me to contribute to the welcoming R community that I encountered when I first started learning. This year, I haven’t been as active in R4DS, but I still contribute occasionally to the community!\nJoin the Slack workspace here.\nRStudio Community\n\nContributor | July 2020 - Present\nWhen I got started with R, I found RStudio Community to be a much more welcoming forum for asking questions than StackOverflow. When I have the time, I contribute to answering questions in RStudio Community, as thanks for all the help I’ve received there. Here is my activity on the site.\n\n\n\n",

Thoroughly sick\nof winter, I have waited in frustration through rainstorm after\nrainstorm for the weather to finally clear enough to make going outside\npleasurable again.\nIn Southern California, it turns out, winter and spring are prime\ntime for hiking and backpacking. There’s not much snow or rain, and\ntemperatures are still cool enough in the desert to be comfortable.\nAccordingly, I took last year’s spring break as an opportunity for a\ngrueling three-day trek in Joshua Tree National Park, with friends\nAshley and Brandon. I wish I had written a trip report. To make a long\nstory short: we carried enormous amounts of water 40 miles across the\ndesert in 3 days, doing the western half of the California Riding and\nHiking Trail as an out-and-back route. Our longest day was 20 miles,\nfarther than I had ever hiked in a single day, with or without a heavy\npack. We weren’t at all prepared for how strenuous it would be. Luckily,\nthe weather cooperated perfectly, gracing us with temperatures no lower\nthan 40 (at night) and no higher than 75 (during the day), with lovely\nbreezes. So despite a multitude of blisters and some extremely sore\nlegs, we made it out, treated ourselves to milkshakes, and patted\nourselves on the back. Somewhere along the way, we also said things like\n“Holy shit, we’re never doing that again” and “That was too many miles”\nand “That was unpleasant.”\n\nExtremely tired backpackers after a long Joshua\nTree trip. Left to right: Ashley, me, Brandon.\n\n\n\nTrip planning\nTragically, Brandon has since moved across the country to UConn. So\nas this year’s spring break approached, Ashley and I started making\nplans for another backpacking trip. Less intense, we thought. Maybe\nsomewhere a little farther afield. We had our sights on Zion, Death\nValley, the Channel Islands, maybe Big Sur or part of the PCT.\nUnfortunately, the winter of 2022-2023 has brought record-breaking\nstorms to Southern CA. All the areas around Big Sur were closed for\ntrail maintenance. Zion, which has borderline weather in March in the\nbest of years, was way too snowy for us to plan a trip with any\nconfidence. Death Valley was a possibility, but we didn’t relish the\nprospect of once again lugging gallons of water across a desert. The\nChannel Islands were, predictably, totally booked up. One possible PCT\nsection was snowy, and another was both boring (apparently) and lacking\nin water (see: Death Valley.)\nDiscouraged, and too busy with the end of the quarter to put a lot of\ntime into trip-planning, we began to wonder if this trip would happen\nafter all.\nTwo weeks before the break, I told my advisor, Noa, about a day\nhike loop that I had done that weekend that included part of the\nBackbone Trail. It happened that her family had also hiked part of the\nBackbone on the same day.\n“The Backbone Trail comes up a lot,” I observed. “It seems to be part\nof most of the hikes I do from AllTrails. How far does it go?”\nI don’t know why I hadn’t wondered this before.\n“All the way through the Santa Monica Mountains,” Noa told me.\nI said, “I wonder if it can be thru-hiked?”\nI’ve never thru-hiked any trail, nor has the concept particularly\nappealed to me. I know people who have hiked the Appalachian Trail\n(2000+ miles) and the Pacific Crest Trail (2600+ miles). But I like\nshowers and real food, and carrying a heavy weight for months on end\nseems like it would take all the fun out of hiking. And yet. The\nBackbone Trail is only 67 miles long. Not all that much longer than the\n40 miles we had done in Joshua Tree. This seemed… attainable, in the\namount of time we had.\nI’ll say it up front: we did not end up thru-hiking\nthe Backbone Trail. Almost immediately after I started researching it, I\nwas discouraged to read that:\n\nThere are only a few campgrounds on and near the Background Trail. We\nrecommend day hiking in section (sic) rather than attempting a\nmulti-day backpacking trip. -National\nPark Service\n\nApparently, the NPS eventually plans to create some backcountry\ncamping sites with permits available. But for now, there are just a few\nplaces where you’re allowed to camp, one of which is now closed.\nI did find a couple people who had completed a Backbone Trail\nthru-hike. The plan I eventually developed was based heavily on this\ntrip report, by Matthew Hengst. I also made heavy use of Halle\nHomel’s article\non the BBT, as well as her argument\nfor hiking it from East to West.\n(As I’m writing this, I see that Shawnté Salabert has also\njust published this\nincredibly impressive account of an Eastbound thru-hike.)\nInstead of trying to contend with AirBnB’s, illegal backcountry\ncamping, or incredibly long marathon-worthy days, I decided that we’d do\njust a partial thru-hike: just under 40 miles out of 67. 3 days. I used\nmy new favorite software, CalTopo, to chart out elevation profiles and a\nroute for a three-day itinerary. 10 miles the first day, 15 the second\nday, 13 the third day. I really wasn’t sure we could do it. That middle\nday, especially, had me worried. 15 miles is a lot for\nus, and the terrain would be significantly more rugged than we had\nexperienced in Joshua Tree. There would be no opportunity to stop early.\nWe’d have to keep going to reach Malibu Creek State Park Campground, 2-3\nmiles off the trail proper, where we would make a pre-paid (and\nrelatively expensive) campsite reservation.\n\nAshley on day 1, going up a very “up”\nsection\n\nAshley (pictured above) is an incredible hiking buddy. The Joshua\nTree 40-miler was only her second backpacking trip ever. In the year\nsince, we had done a few miles in Mojave and several solid day hikes,\nand now she was completely game for another hastily-planned trek of\ninsane proportions. (To be fair, Ashley has also done such unfathomable\nthings as running a marathon in the desert at Burning Man. She’s kind of\nimpressive.) Anyway, she was undeterred by the Day 2 forced march. She\nalso reminded me that we’d never be very far from civilization. We could\nalways bail and catch a ride home.\n\n\nGear and packing\nSo, we decided to do it. First stop: REI. Ashley has a bit of an REI\nproblem, and it’s rubbing off on me. Conveniently, though, we each had\ntwo member discount coupons to use. She bought socks and a new tent. I\nbought a cookware set and… also a tent (We don’t need to talk about what\nhappened to the last one.)\n\nPacking list\nAfter much hemming and hawing about the weather, here is the packing\nlist I settled on.\n<details>\n    <summary>Packing list:<\/summary>\n\n    <p>Clothes (including what I wore on day 1)\n\n5 pairs underwear (I do not compromise on underwear during backpacking trips, for the sake of my own sanity)\n\n2 sports bras (see above)\n\n3 pairs wool socks\n\nTank top\n\nT-shirt\n\nThermal long-sleeved shirt\n\nLightweight quarter-zip long-sleeved shirt with a high neck, for sun protection\n\nSun hat with ear and neck flaps\n\nSunglasses\n\nHiking pants\n\nAthletic shorts\n\nCozy warm sweatpants (for pajamas, or extra warmth on the trail)\n\nRain jacket\n\nLight fleece jacket\n\nHeavier fleece\n\nPuffy jacket\n\nFood\n\nTrader Joe's dried mangoes\n\nCarrots from the farmer's market\n\n2 small cucumbers\n\n2 apples\n\n1 large bag of beef jerky\n\n8 packets of instant oatmeal\n\n6 Clif bars (3 chocolate chip, 3 chocolate mint)\n\n1 cup red lentils, mixed with 1/2 cup alphabet pasta. Also, a small baggie of mixed spices: cumin, coriander, curry powder, garam masala, cayenne pepper, ginger, salt, black pepper, and nutritional yeast.\n\n1 bag Trader Joe's dried peas\n\nHalf a gallon of trail mix: raisins, almonds, roasted chickpeas, M&Ms, cereal.\n\nGear and Other\n\nCompass\n\nPrinted topo maps, in a plastic bag\n\nSwiss army knife\n\nCookware set\n\nTent, with rain fly\n\nSleeping pad\n\nSleeping bag\n\nBowl and spoon\n\nSmall camp towel\n\nWhisperLite stove, fuel bottle, and lighter\n\nPersonal toiletries\n\nPoop trowel\n\nFirst aid kit\n\nGarbage bags (for waterproofing)\n\nWater-resistant stuff sacks (I have two Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil dry bags, 20L and… 2L, I think?)\n\n3 water bottles: 2 1L Nalgenes and 1 1.5L SmartWater bottle.<\/p>\n<\/details>\n\n\nGear reflections\nReflecting on the gear: I was mostly happy. The hat, first aid kit,\ntrowel, rain jacket, and one of the fleeces were new purchases, and they\nall turned out great. I also recently got a new sleeping\npad, after suffering through countless nights on a really\nuncomfortable foam one that I found in the common room of my freshman\nyear dorm in college. This was its second trip, and I continue to be\nextremely happy with it.\nI definitely packed too much clothing. This is always a tradeoff for\nme: being able to wear clean(ish) clothes really helps with my psyche,\nbut of course then it’s heavy. I should have skipped the tank top and\npossibly also the shorts. I also could have done with fewer pairs of\nunderwear. I definitely could have brought fewer warm\nlayers. The nights weren’t as cold as I had feared, so my light fleece\nand puffy jacket ended up being used mostly as a pillow. But hypothermia\nis no joke, so I’m glad I played it safe.\nThe other thing we brought was too much food. Way too much food.\nPounds and pounds of extra food. I ended up eating about a tenth of the\njerky, and the two of us together barely accomplished half of the trail\nmix. Ashley carried an entire bag of baby carrots that we never broke\ninto. We would come to regret those carrots.\n\n\n\nDay 1\n\nWill Rogers\nMy roommate, Kat, dropped us off at Will Rogers State Park around 9am\non Tuesday, March 28th. We filled our water bottles, distributed our\ngear, and made sure our packs were ready to go. I had been wearing pants\nbut changed into shorts; the sun was warm already. We slathered on some\nsunscreen. Several people in the parking lot eyed our packs curiously. A\nconvoy of seven or so cyclists rolled past, and one woman swung over to\nask us if we were “training.” Nope, not training, just having fun. She\nrode away.\nThe very first section of the trail was narrow and switchback-y, and\noverflowing with wildflowers. It was much warmer than I had anticipated.\nWe wound around to the west of Inspiration Point and came to a junction\nwith a map, which I scrutinized. I had brought along my compass, which\nI’m still learning how to use. The plan, since we’d be near civilization\nmost of the time, was to use the compass first and primarily, and check\nmyself with my phone’s GPS when possible. Less than half a mile in, I\nhadn’t expected to already not know exactly where we were, and the\ncompass wasn’t coming naturally to me yet. I tried for a few minutes to\nmake sense of the several branching trails in front of us. We couldn’t\npossibly be lost, but I couldn’t seem to make the posted map match my\ntopo. Eventually I caved and looked at my phone’s GPS. And back at the\nmap. And back at the GPS. The GPS matched where I had thought we must be\nbased on the compass alone, but the “you are here” on the posted map\ndisagreed. I’m still convinced it’s wrong. I shrugged and we walked\non.\nA few severe switchbacks after another tenth of a mile confirmed that\nmy navigation had been right. We stopped at an overlook, where a woman\npointed to a bush and told us there were already snakes out, that she\nhad seen one. A little further on, we crossed a bridge over a gorge,\nstopping to chat with an older couple. They also asked us if we were\n“training.” We were increasingly confused. Training for what? “Well, why\ndo you have these big packs?” Aha. Everyone apparently thought we were\nday-hiking, with extra weight for the heck of it. We clarified our\ncamping plans. Then we had a good laugh at the idea of carrying all of\nthis out of anything other than immediate necessity.\nAnother mile of our “training hike” brought us to a juncture of three\ntrails. One shot off to the east, while ours stayed flat and just north\nof west, and a center option headed up a ridge slightly more northward.\nI gave Ashley a little compass tutorial. A refresher on how to read\ncontour lines and identify peaks confirmed that the left and center\ntrails would take us to the same juncture, but the one would skirt the\nedge of a small ridge while the other hit several peaks along the\nway.\nWe continued for another mile along the lower trail, winding in and\nout of the shade. The vegetation was so lush that at times we felt like\nwe were in a jungle, not a desert. We could see the sea. I asked about\nticks. Ashley wasn’t sure, but we agreed to check at camp that night (We\nforgot. I recommend taking this more seriously than we did).\n\nPushing through lush grass.\n\nAt 11:15, we stopped for a snack break at the top of a hill, under a\nlarge oak. We munched on carrots and fruit and watched a dense trail of\nants make its way up the trunk. There was a bench, but we sat on the\nground in the shade instead. I am sure the view was lovely, but I was\ntired and wanted to keep sitting.\n(Actually, I did a pretty bad job of taking pictures on this hike. I\nwas trying to preserve phone charge as much as possible, since we would\nneed to call a ride on Day 3. Next time, I’d bring a more serious\nbattery pack. Documenting more would have been nice, and I’m sure it\nwould have weighed less than the carrots.)\n\nThe bench, which we could have sat on but\ndidn’t.\n\n\nAshley, having a plum.\n\nFor the next three miles, we climbed a bit and headed mostly due\nnorth, along a bit of a ridge. The slope dropped away to our left, and\nin a few places the trail had partially fallen apart with the recent\nrains. We could infer the presence of a creek far below. A large\nalligator lizard stretched itself across the trail at one point,\nsunning. (Unfortunately, it left before I could get a closer\npicture).\n\nAlligator lizard, sunbathing.\n\nThe trail bent to the west and started winding through some really\ngorgeous blooming Ceanothus. Unfortunately, this is also when the poison\noak started showing up, shiny and pale green in its fresh abundance. We\nstopped for lunch in a carefully-selected, un-poison-oaky shady spot. I\nsat on what turned out to be thistles, but luckily they were tender\nenough that any prickling was minor. We ate cheese quesadillas that\nAshley had thrown together that morning. Also trail mix, carrots (mine,\nnot hers, which remained unopened), dates, and a granola bar. At our\nfirst snack break (just under 3 miles from the start), we had been a\nlittle worried about our pace. But we had made good time to lunch,\nreaching 5.75 miles around 12:50.\n\nCeanothus in full bloom.\n\n\nA gorgeous California peony (Paeonia\ncalifornica).\n\n\nMore Ceanothus.\n\n\n\nTemescal Peak\nA short while later, we came out on top of a ridge with several\ntrails winding away below us. We could see the city in the distance.\n(This is the drawback of hiking so near to LA). A peak to our right was\nprobably Temescal Peak, but since we weren’t quite sure, we continued on\nuntil the trail intersected with a fire road, at which point I knew\nexactly where we were. We dropped our packs and ran (yes, ran! I felt\nbouncy and free without the extra load) 0.1 miles back to a spur trail\njunction we had passed, which we followed up to the top of the peak.\nOn top of Temescal Peak, around 2pm, we took selfies. We also met a\nlarge, dark western fence lizard (Sceloporus occidentalis), who\ndid some push-ups and then came boldly over to our rock.\n\nOn top of Temescal Peak, featuring LA and the\nocean in the background.\n\n\nOn top of Temescal Peak.\n\n\nA very handsome lizard friend.\n\nWe came down from the peak. It was just after 2pm, and we had already\ndone 7 miles out of our 10 for the day. From 423’ elevation at the\nparking lot, we had reached 2105’, or highest point for Day 1. It would\nbe mostly down from here on out.\n\n\nHub Junction\nWe followed the fire road to an overlook at the Hub Junction, where\nwe each used the pit toilet. We sat a bit under a shade shelter, where\nwe read about the geology of the peak we had just descended.\n\nWithout knowing it, we climbed “the most\ngeologically complex place in the Santa Monica Mountains.”\n\nAt the Hub Junction, we also chatted with an older couple day-hiking\nfrom Trippett Ranch. They each had hiking poles and cool hip belts to\nhold water bottles. They confirmed that of the three trail options, we\nwanted the most uphill one (of course). This confirmed what my compass\nhad told me, which was gratifying. While the trail hadn’t been hard to\nfollow, it also hadn’t been clearly signposted as the Backbone Trail,\nand the sheer number of junctions and intersections in Will Rogers and\nTopanga State Parks had made things confusing.\nUp we went, and then down, down down. A man coming in the opposite\ndirection warned us about a rattlesnake, but we turned onto the trail\ntoward Musch soon after. The next mile or so was relatively gentle\nswitchbacks, through fields of flowers that seemed to change on each\nslope. California poppies, lupines, lots of different yellow flowers\nthat I didn’t recognize, and blue dicks, which I spent the entire next\nday trying to remember the name of (it would finally come to me at the\nend of Day 2). In among the switchbacks were several creek crossings. I\nwas 95% sure that Musch would have running water, but the sites I had\nfound hadn’t been completely clear. At least now I knew we could head\nback to the stream in a pinch.\n\n\nMusch Trail Camp\nAround 4pm, we crossed a meadow for the final stretch in to camp. A\nman lay on a rock, basking in the sun. Around us was grass, surrounded\nby trees, and bordered to the south by houses that we could only\nslightly see.\nThe camp was small and located right next to the trail. 8 sites, all\nclose together in a row, were separated by picnic tables and large\nstumps. There was a bathroom, with two stalls with flush toilets,\nlights, and toilet paper, and two outdoor sinks with running water.\nWe chose Site 8, at the end farthest from the trail, under a large\noak tree that several acorn woodpeckers were busy excavating (much to my\ndelight). The day’s 10 miles were behind us, and we felt calm and\ncontent. The sun was warm, and we still had several hours of daylight. A\nfew day hikers milled around, but none stayed long, and we had the site\nmostly to ourselves.\n\n\nAmy\nAshley began setting up the tent. In all our preparation, we had\nforgotten to bring cash to pay the campsite fee. I asked a few passing\nhikers if they had any, but nobody did, so I took a few essentials in my\nsweatshirt pocket and prepared to hike a mile down to the parking lot to\npay with a credit card. Just before I set out on the trail, I met Amy.\nShe was coming out of a grassy field on a trail I hadn’t noticed before,\nno more than a little deer track. She had long, straight, dark blonde\nhair. Her lips pouted outward slightly in that very familiar way of\nwealthy LA women. I don’t remember her shirt, but she wore flowing linen\npants and flip flops.\nAmy seemed delighted to see me. We talked for a while about how nice\nthe day was. She lived nearby, just down the road in the houses we had\nglimpsed through the trees. She hadn’t been taking as much advantage of\nthe trails as she wanted to, she said. Hence the little walk up, in flip\nflops, just to take a look around.\nI told her about our backpacking trip, and she was floored. “So many\nmiles!” I finally thought to ask if she had any cash, for the campsite.\nShe didn’t. “The ranger doesn’t usually check, though. He lives up\nthere, and if anything, he’ll come by in the morning.”\nI thanked her. “I’d feel bad not paying, though, and it’s only\nanother mile. So much easier without a heavy pack on!” But Amy\nabsolutely wouldn’t hear of it. She had cash at home, and she lived just\nsix houses down. A whole mile to the parking lot? And then a\nmile back? And yes, she had Venmo, and no, she wouldn’t let me\npay her back, it was no problem at all, really, and she was so impressed\nand so happy to see us and…\nIt’s not like I was relishing the thought of an additional two miles\nof hiking. And she insisted so much that it started to feel like I was\ndoing her a favor.\nWe walked down the road toward her house, not down the trail she had\ncome up (I’m not sure why). We chatted, and I told her about our hiking\nplans and our Joshua Tree adventure the previous year. “No way!” She and\nher partner had gotten lost in Joshua Tree once, 20-some miles from\ntheir car, and had flagged down a ranger for help. (I think I’m\nremembering that story correctly?) It sounded like less of a backpacking\ntrip than an accidental day-hike detour, but I didn’t ask too many\nquestions.\nAmy’s house had empty alkaline water jugs outside the front gate,\nwhich was covered by a wooden arch and some vines. The front path led\ninto the kitchen of a gorgeous house, all natural materials, airy\nwindows, wooden floors, and light. I could see through to the back and\nout the windows, which looked out on a steeply sloping backyard,\nsomewhat terraced and containing several fruit trees (as well as another\narch, with more vines). An elderly dog, cow-spotted and built like a\ntank, with prominent nipples, waddled huffily over to us from where she\nhad been resting on the living room floor, tail wagging. (I’m\nembarrassed that I don’t remember her name.) Her collar was leather,\nprobably handmade and studded with 25 or 30 circular turquoise\ncabochons. Amy invited me in while she went to get the cash. I hesitated\nbecause of my muddy boots, but she insisted that the floor was filthy\nanyway (it wasn’t), so I walked through to the back porch and sat for a\nfew minutes on a chair next to the dog, who followed me out. We looked\ndown the sloping backyard together. For a few moments, I contemplated\nlife as a Topanga homeowner. Then Amy reappeared with the cash, and I\nthanked her profusely.\nIt was going to rain that night. Amy was extremely concerned for our\nwell-being and offered her guest house for us to stay in if we changed\nour minds (“Just come down here and knock on the door, I’m\nserious, I’d be happy to have you.”) Her partner was\nsleeping there currently, she added, but she could kick him out. Dinner,\ntoo, was generously offered, but I demurred, painting a tantalizing\npicture of the Annie’s mac and cheese I was looking forward to. Before I\nleft, I was obliged to meet the other elderly dog, Jasmine. She lived in\nthe guest house, and came out excitedly (as quickly as she could) to\ngreet Amy. Same turquoise-studded collar. Same huffing noises. A very\nsweet animal. There were apparently bunnies somewhere too. Far from\noverstaying my welcome, though, I was getting the sense that if I didn’t\nhead back to camp soon, I’d end up adopted. So I said my goodbyes, got\nintroduced to a neighbor on the way out, and jogged part of the way back\nup the hill to Ashley. Who was very surprised to see me back so soon. I\ntold the tale as I cooked mac and cheese over the stove, two boxes each.\nShe organized our clothes and belongings.\n\nTwinning at the campsite under the woodpecker\ntree. Not pictured: our matching green backpacks and my tent, which\ndidn’t come on this trip but is identical to Ashley’s.\n\n\n\nEvening\nCozy pasta and sweatshirts rounded out our evening. I insisted we use\nthe last of the daylight to do some stretching in the meadow, which we\ndid until it got abruptly cold just before sundown. Coyotes started\nyipping from the meadow almost as soon as we got back to camp. Dogs from\nthe houses below joined in, lower-pitched. I took a detailed sponge bath\nat the sinks, wincing in the chilly breeze as the Dr. Bronner’s soap\nmade my skin feel even colder. In bed, I wrote a little, and we listened\nto the canine chorus. Then I stuck my head out of the tent and saw eyes\nlooking back at me from the trail, maybe 30 meters away. I yelped. The\neyes blinked, turned, turned back, blinked again. Human eyes don’t shine\nlike that, and they’re not so low to the ground. It was probably a\nraccoon. A coyote. A bobcat. I made Ashley come with me to the bathroom\none last time. I finished first and stepped out, and fuck,\nthere was a coyote right there, 10 feet away, on the road by\nthe sinks. Same eyes. I was more startled than anything, cradled by the\nconcrete bathroom walls. I don’t remember if Ashley poked her head out\nin time to see the animal before it trotted up the road toward the\nranger’s house.\nBack in the tent, we heard an owl. We talked a little about how eerie\nit was that the campsite was so wild, yet so close to civilization. I\nwasn’t sure I liked it. A little uncanny. I fell asleep pretty quickly\nand only woke a few hours later when the rain started, then slept\nintermittently but deeply through the pattering all night.\n\n\n\nDay 2\n\nGRFP\nIn the half light of the early morning, a caterpillar inched its way\nover the tent exterior, enjoying a little shelter from the rain. Its\nsucker-like back and front feet made tiny circles on the tent fabric. It\nwas still pouring. Ashley was still asleep. I kind of had to pee, but I\nwas also comfortably dry. My shoes, in the vestibule outside, were\nsitting in a half-inch puddle. Thank goodness we had brought the packs\ninto the tent.\nAgainst my better judgment, I took out my phone and turned off\nairplane mode. I had wanted to disconnect on this trip, but\nunfortunately, I had cell service.\nA few texts came in. And then another one.\n\nMichael: Congrats on the GRFP!\n\nWhat?\nMichael is a friend of mine from union organizing. We don’t usually\ntext much, except to coordinate card-signing walkthroughs. As far as I\nknow, he’s not much of a prankster.\nI opened my email. Nothing. I hadn’t expected GRFP results until\nApril. What was happening?\n\nMe: what???\nMichael: You got the nsf grfp! (Apparently, my friend saw your name\non the list, I didn’t look)\n\nAnd then the emails loaded. And there it was. Three years of research\nfunding. No more teaching. Freedom to pursue new projects. A much-needed\naffirmation of my worth as a scientist. Ashley wasn’t even awake\nyet.\n[more about how I felt here]\n\n\nOut from Musch\n\nBeautiful views on the second morning, as the\nrain clouds cleared.\n\nWe had meant to get an early start to our extremely long day, but by\n8am the rain was only starting to taper. By the time we got packed and\nready, it was 9:30. We took the trail out of Musch in the direction I\nwould have gone to pay the campsite fee if not for Amy’s intervention.\nIt was immediately clear that this was going to be hard. We slipped at\nevery step, the soles of our shoes eating into the trail and leaving\ndiagonal slash-mark tracks. The views across the valley and over the\ndripping trees were beautiful, and we crossed several babbling streams.\nEverything was lush and green to a surreal degree. A little less than a\nmile in, we forded a puddle that ate up the whole width of the trail.\nFrom there, the trail turned to a dirt track through a field, and it\nsloped gently upward to a small road intersection.\n\nThe puddle, taking us out of the woods and into\nthe field.\n\nA woman in a rain poncho stood where the trail met the road, watching\nus approach. She and I made a little small talk while Ashley came up\nbehind me, and I explained our adventure. She was there for an\nunspecified photo shoot (and sure enough, when we reached the Trippet\nRanch parking lot a few minutes later, we found it full of tents and\npeople and vans full of equipment).\nThere is a water spigot at the junction of the Backbone Trail and\nthat road north of Trippet, around (34.09511501549349,\n-118.58690568890553), in case anyone was wondering. I didn’t test\nit.\nOnward! We made it to the Trippet parking lot, crossing a bridge over\na remarkably full pond and roaring stream, before checking the map and\nrealizing the BBT continued on the opposite side of the bridge from the\nparking lot. Oops. Back over the bridge we went, and onward, on a very\npleasant little stretch of trail. The ground was gravely, and the trail\nskirted the edge of a lovely oak woodland (on our left) while a field\nstretched out to the right.\n\nPossibly the prettiest stretch of trail yet,\nalong the edge of an oak woodland near the Trippet Ranch parking\nlot.\n\nUnfortunately, the trail from then on was a muddy slip-n-slide. I’d\nactually love to go back and hike this stretch in drier weather, because\nthe switchbacks through beautiful scrubby habitat were breathtaking.\n\n\n\nDay 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
