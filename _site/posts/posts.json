Originally from magrittr, it’s now characteristic of most tidyverse code. Using %>% has revolutionized how I write code in R. But sometimes the basic pipe falls short.\ntable() is one of my favorite functions for exploring data in R: it creates a frequency table of values in a vector. I use table() to do sanity checks on my data, make sure that all factor levels are present, and generally get a sense of how my observations are distributed.\nA while back, though, I noticed that table() didn’t play nice with the %>% pipe.\nI’ve collected some data on my friends’ pets. Here it is (using pseudonyms, in case anyone has a secret pet they don’t want the world to know about…).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: This is one of the cats in the data frame below. She would like to hold your hand.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Load magrittr\nlibrary(magrittr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Create data\npets <- data.frame(\n  friend = c(\"Mark\", \"Mark\", \"Kyle\", \"Kyle\", \"Miranda\", \"Kayla\", \n             \"Kayla\", \"Kayla\", \"Adriana\", \"Adriana\", \"Alex\", \"Randy\", \"Nancy\"), \n  pet = c(\"cat\", \"cat\", \"cat\", \"cat\", \"cat\", \"dog\", \"cat\", \"lizard\", \n          \"cat\", \"cat\", \"dog\", \"dog\", \"woodpecker\"), \n  main_pet_color = c(\"brown\", \"brown\", \"multi\", \"multi\", \"brown\", \n                     \"brown\", \"brown\", \"orange\", \"black\", \"white\", \n                     \"multi\", \"white\", \"multi\")) \n\n# Look at the data\npets\n\n\n    friend        pet main_pet_color\n1     Mark        cat          brown\n2     Mark        cat          brown\n3     Kyle        cat          multi\n4     Kyle        cat          multi\n5  Miranda        cat          brown\n6    Kayla        dog          brown\n7    Kayla        cat          brown\n8    Kayla     lizard         orange\n9  Adriana        cat          black\n10 Adriana        cat          white\n11    Alex        dog          multi\n12   Randy        dog          white\n13   Nancy woodpecker          multi\n\nUnsurprisingly, it looks like there are a lot of cats and dogs! There are also a lot of brown pets and a lot of multicolored ones. Let’s say I want to see a frequency table of the pet colors. I know that I can do this with table(), like so:\n\n\n# Make a frequency table of pet colors\ntable(pets$main_pet_color)\n\n\n\n black  brown  multi orange  white \n     1      5      4      1      2 \n\nBut if I want to use tidy syntax, I might try to do it this way instead:\n\n\npets %>%\n  table(main_pet_color)\n\n\nError in table(., main_pet_color): object 'main_pet_color' not found\n\nWhat’s up with this? The syntax should work. pet is definitely a valid variable name in the data frame pets, and if I had used a different function, like arrange(), I would have had no problems:\n\n\n# Arrange the data frame by pet color\npets %>% arrange(main_pet_color) # works fine!\n\n\n    friend        pet main_pet_color\n1  Adriana        cat          black\n2     Mark        cat          brown\n3     Mark        cat          brown\n4  Miranda        cat          brown\n5    Kayla        dog          brown\n6    Kayla        cat          brown\n7     Kyle        cat          multi\n8     Kyle        cat          multi\n9     Alex        dog          multi\n10   Nancy woodpecker          multi\n11   Kayla     lizard         orange\n12 Adriana        cat          white\n13   Randy        dog          white\n\nSo why doesn’t this work with table()?? This problem has driven me crazy on several occasions. I always ended up reverting back to the table(pets$main_pet_color) syntax, but I was not happy about it.\nTurns out, there’s a simple fix.\nSolution\nIntroducing… a new pipe! %$% is called the “exposition pipe,” according to the magrittr package documentation, and it’s basically the tidy version of the with() function, which I wrote about previously.\nIf we simply swap out %>% for %$% in our failed code above, it works!\n\n\n# Make a frequency table of pet colors\npets %$% table(main_pet_color)\n\n\nmain_pet_color\n black  brown  multi orange  white \n     1      5      4      1      2 \n\nImportant note: Make sure you have magrittr loaded if you want to use this pipe. dplyr includes the basic %>%, but not the other magrittr pipes.\nWhy it works\nThe traditional pipe, %>%, works by passing a data frame or tibble into the next function. But that only works if the function you’re piping to is set up to take a data frame/tibble as an argument!\nFunctions in the tidyverse, like arrange(), are set up to take this kind of argument, so that piping works seamlessly. But many base R functions take vectors as inputs instead.\nThat’s the case with table(). When we write table(pets$main_pet_color), the argument pets$main_pet_color is a vector:\n\n\n# This returns a vector\npets$main_pet_color\n\n\n [1] \"brown\"  \"brown\"  \"multi\"  \"multi\"  \"brown\"  \"brown\"  \"brown\" \n [8] \"orange\" \"black\"  \"white\"  \"multi\"  \"white\"  \"multi\" \n\nWhen we try to pass pets into table() with the pipe, table() expects a vector but gets a data frame instead, and it throws an error.\nThe %$% pipe “exposes” the column names of the data frame to the function you’re piping to, allowing that function to make sense of the data frame that is passed to it.\nOutcome\nThe exposition pipe is great for integrating non-tidyverse functions into a tidy workflow. The outcome for me is that I can finally make frequency tables to my heart’s content, without “code switching” back from tidy to base R syntax. Of course, the downside is that you do have to install magrittr, which is sometimes an extra dependency that I don’t want to deal with. But it’s nice to have the option!\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Congrats, you made it to the end! Here are some more cats for you.\n\n\n\nResources\nmagrittr has a couple other pipes, too: %T% and %<>%. The package also has some nice aliases for basic arithmetic functions that allow them to be incorporated into a chain of pipes.

But thanks to some help from my lab and my university, last week I flew out to sunny San Francisco for the 2020 rstudio::conf, and I had a blast. Here are some things I learned and some avenues I’m excited to explore in the future.\n1. The R community is awesome.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: This art is by RStudio artist-in-residence Allison Horst. She does amazing illustrations! You can find her work on her GitHub page.\n\n\n\nI was pretty nervous to attend this conference. I’ve never really considered myself a computer person, and I learned R pretty much accidentally through my work in biology. In my experience, people who do a lot of computer programming tend to use a lot of intimidating jargon, and I was scared I’d flounder.\nI was surprised at how genuinely welcome I felt. At meals and talks, I sat down next to random people and asked what they did or how they knew R. I met people with so many diverse interests! Among others:\n• A linguist now working for a nonprofit • A neuroscience PhD now working for Facebook • Several young professors teaching data science at their schools • A woman who flew from Brazil (!!) to attend the conference • Someone just getting to know R • Two young people who interned at RStudio, despite not being experts in R • An RStudio bigwig (swoon!) • A professor working on genomic data • A researcher at the Smithsonian • An aquatic ecologist who uses R for work • So many people! You get the gist. •\nAnd they were all happy to talk to me!\n2. So much happens on Twitter.\nI joined Twitter on a whim this fall, and it has been awesome. I learned about this conference through Twitter. I’ve found some internships through Twitter. And by following the #rstats hashtag and some key people in the R community, I’ve learned all sorts of tips and tricks about the kinds of things you can do with Twitter.\nApart from that, lots of people were live-tweeting the rstudio::conf, and I tried my hand at that, too! A highlight was when the one and only Hadley Wickham liked one of my tweets.\n3. I need to start making Shiny apps.\nAs I said in my tweet (the one that Hadley liked!), this conference convinced me that I really should start building apps with R Shiny as soon as possible.\nWhy haven’t I done this already?\nThe main reason is that the word “app” strikes fear into my heart. Surely I can’t develop an app??\nShiny apps are web apps, which is a little less intimidating, somehow. The basic gist of Shiny apps is that they are ways to explore your data interactively. That’s it. Some Shiny apps can get pretty complicated. For example, here’s a cool dashboard for visualizing tweets about the 2019 rstudio::conf. As you can see, it’s pretty fancy.\n\n\n\nBut Shiny apps can also be pretty simple, like this one, which shows a simple histogram of the duration of eruptions of the Old Faithful geyser:\n\n\n\nThis app just lets the user change the number of histogram bins, include a density curve, and show the individual observations on the x axis. Pretty simple, but still so much better than a static visualization! I really have no excuse not to make something like this.\nIn particular, I can’t wait to build an app for the Yale Grammatical Diversity Project (YGDP). I’m currently working with the YGDP to help organize their database of linguistic survey data. I’ve already created some reports in RMarkdown to help visualize the data (you can see an example here). But wouldn’t this be so much better if it were interactive??\n\n\n\n4. Bonus: fun with hex stickers\nI finally got to experience the hype about hexagon stickers for R packages. They are so pretty and fun, and they fit together so nicely! I picked up a whole bunch:\n\n\n\nAnd, funnily enough, I’ve been playing with hexagons as wall decorations for a while now, before I even knew about hex stickers…\n\n\n\n…so obviously, the possibilities now are truly endless. Hexagons on hexagons? A hex collage on the wall and one on my computer? Wow.\n\n\n\n",

It’s also easy to lose track of whether or not you’ve incorporated package loading into the script itself until you switch to a new computer or restart R and all of a sudden, your packages need to be re-loaded.\nContext\nWhen I was first starting out in R, I learned quickly to load packages all together at the top of a script, not along the way as I needed them. But it took a while, until I started using R Projects, before I decided to centralize package loading above the script level. I was sick of having to deal with loading the right packages at the right times, so I decided to just streamline the whole thing.\nSolution\nMake a separate R script, called “libraries.R” or “packages.R” or something. Keep it consistent. Mine is always called “libraries,” and I keep it in my project folder.\n\n\n\nThe script looks something like this (individual packages may vary, of course):\n\n\n\nThen, at the top of each analysis script, I can simply source the libraries script, and all the libraries I need load automatically.\n\n\n\nOutcome\nI can easily load libraries in the context of a single R Project, keep track of which ones are loaded, and not have to worry about making my scripts look messy with a whole chunk of library() commands at the top of each one. It’s also straightforward to pop open the “libraries” script whenever I want to add a new package or delete one.\n\n\n\n",
